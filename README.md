# 1. Matlab tool for visualizing corresponding regions in marmoset and mouse brains. 
main: marmoset_mouse_region_compare.m

The user will be asked to specify a species (i.e. mouse or marmoset) and a brain region (ID, acronym, or partial region name). The tool will provide
1) 3D view comparisons of the brain region and subregions in the two reference atlases
2) Coronal view comparisons of the brain region and subregions
3) Hierarchical structures of the region's parent regions and all children branches.
